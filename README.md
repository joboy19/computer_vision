# Computer Vision - Yolo Object Detection & Stereo Disparity Mapping
Research project on the implementation of yolo object detection and stereo disparity mapping for depth 
estimations on important objects (other vehicles and people) for potential automated vehicles. Report
with investigations recorded is found here too. 

Code is currently specific to non-public camera stream and yolo object detection weights.
